// `other` is the honest answer for an agent id analytics has never heard of.
// It is the wrong answer for one we ship: an agent that lands there is invisible
// to any breakdown or alert asking *which* CLI failed, which is the only
// question worth asking when a CLI someone installed cannot be used. Adding a
// runtime def without teaching the tracking enum about it fails here.
//
// This asserts against SHIPPED_AGENT_DEFS rather than AGENT_DEFS on purpose.
// AGENT_DEFS also carries the local profiles declared in the developer's own
// `agents.local.json`, whose ids are required not to collide with a shipped one
// and so correctly collapse to `other`. Walking that list would turn anyone's
// personal config into a failure that reads exactly like a missing mapper case,
// and the next person to hit it could not tell the two apart.
