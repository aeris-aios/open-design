// @vitest-environment jsdom
//
// OPEND-2160 red spec: in the version-history panel, the button that opens a
// version reads as "share".
//
// What the code actually does (verified against a live runtime):
//
//   * icon:   RemixIcon `external-link-line` — a box with an arrow leaving it,
//             close enough to the iOS share glyph to be read as one.
//   * label:  `fileViewer.versions.open` = "Open preview" — it names the
//             action but never says the preview opens somewhere ELSE.
//   * action: `openVersionInNewTab` → `openSandboxedPreviewInNewTab(...)`.
//
// So the function is right and the icon is defensible; what is missing is the
// destination. Naming it makes the arrow-leaving-a-box glyph read the way it
// was meant to, which resolves the mismatch without turning an icon choice
// into a guess.
//
// This copy is a tooltip on an icon-only button — the only text the user ever
// gets for that control — so it has to carry the destination in every locale,
// not just English.
